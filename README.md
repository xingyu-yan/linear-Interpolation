# linear-Interpolation
This program is for linear interpolation.

By using linear regation, the objective is to make up some missing values with prediction and linear interpolation.
As shown in figure linear interpolation.png, linear regration is used to obtain the fitting curve based on the existing data (red points). Then, the missing values are predicted by using linear interpolation (blue cross).
